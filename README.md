### Part 1: _The unit circle_

We mentioned at the end of yesterday's class that we need to normalise our `g_player_movement` vector to avoid having our spites move twice as fast when moving diagonally. We do this with the `glm::normalize()` function:

```c++
if (glm::length(g_player_movement) > 1.0f)
{
    g_player_movement = glm::normalize(g_player_movement);
}
```

<sub>**Code Block 1**: The length of a vector, more commonly called its [**magnitude**](https://www.cuemath.com/magnitude-of-a-vector-formula/), is calculated by taking the square-root of the sum of its squared components. The magnitude of the `g_player_movement` vector is greater than 1.0 when the sprite is moving in more than one cartesian axis.</sub>

What [**normalisation**](https://www.freetext.org/Introduction_to_Linear_Algebra/Basic_Vector_Operations/Normalization/) does is turn a vector with a length greater than 1.0 to its **unit circle** equivalent. The purpose here is to scale back the vector to our desired 1.0 limit _without changing its direction_:

This actually has greater implications when it comes to handling player input. A joystick's input, after all, is inherently circular, while keystrokes (e.g. `WASD`) make squares. Pressing `D` to move left gives us a movement vector of `[1, 0]` (a magnitude 1.0 vector), while pressing both `D` and `W` to move diagonally yields `[1, 1]`—a magnitude 1.414 vector. This, in effect, means that by moving diagonally, we are moving about 40% faster than if we only move in one direction.

That's the real reason why code block 1 is necessary. Nothing particularly complicated, but certainly good to know, as it will affect your players' experience.

### Part 2: _Collision Detection Theory_

Really kind of the last thing required for us to make something worth of the "video game" title is some sort of physics simulation. The easiest of these is **collision detection**, so it is no surprise that it was one of the first (if not _the_ first) to get implemented into a game:

![pong-gif](assets/pong_gif.webp)

<sub>**Figure 2**: Collision detection is, quite literally, the entire _raison d'être_ of Atari's [**Pong**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).</sub>

Nowadays, there are several ways of detecting collisions—all of them available to you—so let's take a look at them.

<a id="circle-to-circle"></a>

#### **Circle-to-circle collisions**

The easiest to calculate is _circle to circle collision detection_. Games like [***Hundreds***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundreds_(video_game)) and [***agar.io***](https://agar.io/) almost entirely rely on collisions of this kind, and both are massively popular. One of them was even designed by an [**NYU professor**](http://www.nealen.net/):

My favourite, though, would have to be the absolute arcade classic, Atari's [**Asteroids**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)):

Really, the only thing involved in circle-to-circle detection is a simple distance calculation from their centres. If we are in a cartesian plane, we can easily calculate this distance using the Pythagorean theorem:

![circle-to-circle](assets/circle-to-circle.jpg)

<sub>**Figure 5**: The mathematics of circle-to-circle collision detection. Doesn't get more simple than this. [**Source**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/opengl-game-development/9781783288199/ch05s03.html)</sub>

In other words, _if the distance from the centres of the circles is less than the sum of their respective radii, we have a **collision**_.

<a id="point-to-circle"></a>

#### **Point-to-circle collisions**

There's plenty of uses for point-to-circle collision detection:

- Clicking on a UI element with a mouse pointer.
- Move the player by selecting a target destination.
- Select a target to approach / attack.

Arguably easier than circle-to-circle, the math of point-to-circle is calculated by measuring the distance between the point to the centre of the circle. If the _point's distance is, at any point, smaller than the length of the radius, we have a collision_. We can calculate this using the distance formula:

#### **Box-to-box collisions**

While the previous two collisions are easy to calculate, they are not the ones that we will likely be using the most. That honour goes to box-to-box collisions.

If you're not convinced, check out the following diagram:

<sub>**Figure 7**: Picturing Megaman in terms of boxes. [**Source**](http://www.kilobolt.com/collision-detection-basics)</sub>

The mathematics for this is interesting. We need to keep track of the box's centre (the same way we would with a circle). Let's call them _C1_ and _C2_:

1. Calculate the absolute difference (X<sub>diff</sub>) C1<sub>_x_</sub> and C2<sub>_x_</sub>.
2. Do the same for C1<sub>_y_</sub> and C2<sub>_y_</sub> (Y<sub>diff</sub>).
3. Calculate the distance between C1<sub>_x_</sub> and C2<sub>_x_</sub>. The formula for this is X<sub>distance</sub> = X<sub>diff</sub> - (width<sub>1</sub> + width<sub>2</sub>) / 2.
3. Calculate the distance between C1<sub>_y_</sub> and C2<sub>_y_</sub>. The formula for this is Y<sub>distance</sub> = Y<sub>diff</sub> - (height<sub>1</sub> + height<sub>2</sub>) / 2.
4. If both X<sub>distance</sub> and Y<sub>distance</sub> are below 0.0, you have a collision.

<sub>**Figure 8**: Visualisation of box-to-box collisions.</sub>

In code, this might look at follows:

```c++
float x_distance = fabs(x_coord_a - x_coord_b) - ((width_a + width_b) / 2.0f);
float y_distance = fabs(y_coord_a - y_coord_b) - ((height_a + height_b) / 2.0f);

if (x_distance < 0 && y_distance < 0)
{
    // Collision!
}
```

#### **Point-to-box collisions**

One last collision type that is relatively common is point-to-box; UI buttons in many games are square—shaped, for example. This one is pretty easy: simply _get the coordinates of the **top left** and **bottom right** corners, and check the points' coordinates fall inside of them_.

<!-- ### Part 3: _Example_

Let's take a look at a simple example using a modified version of our [**user input exercise**](https://github.com/sebastianromerocruz/CS3113-material/tree/main/exercises/player_input):

![collision-ex-1](assets/collision-ex-1.gif)

<sub>**Figure 10**: Now we have a second object in our scene.</sub>

Let's add code onto our `main.cpp` file so that, should the two objects "collide", the message `"COLLISION!"` is printed onto our console–something simple; we'll get to more complex behaviour soon enough.

I'm going to add the lines from code block 2 and adapt them to our situation, taking the flower as object `a` and the cup as object `b`:

1. **`x_coord_a`**: The current horizontal location of our flower can be accessed through `g_flower_position.x`.
2. **`x_coord_b`**: The current horizontal location of our cup can be accessed through `CUP_INIT_POS.y`, since the cup never moves in our scene.
3. **`y_coord_a`**: The current vertical location of our flower can be accessed through `g_flower_position.y`.
4. **`y_coord_b`**: The current vertical location of our cup can be accessed through `CUP_INIT_POS.y`, since the cup never moves in our scene.
5. **`width_a`** and **`height_a`**: The dimensions of your objects will vary from object to object, but a good starting point is assuming that the width is `1.0f` (following the dimensions of the square that the vertex coordinates) multiplied by whatever scaling factor you may have used. In this case, `FLOWER_INIT_SCA` can provide both `x`- and `y`-facts. Because my sprite doesn't occupy the entire image file, this number might not be accurate, but we can fine-tune it later.
6. **`width_b`** and **`height_b`**: Same story as number 5, but with `CUP_INIT_SCA`. Since this object is scaled to be larger, we might have to fine-tune this one even more for it to feel 'natural'.

I am going to place my collision detection at the top of my `update` function. This is not strictly necessary, but your transformations may depend on your objects not touching each other (e.g. if you touch an enemy/wall, your character should probably stop moving):¬

```c++
void update()
{
    /** ———— COLLISION DETECTION ———— **/    
    float x_distance = fabs(g_flower_position.x - CUP_INIT_POS.x) - ((FLOWER_INIT_SCA.x + CUP_INIT_SCA.x) / 2.0f);
    float y_distance = fabs(g_flower_position.y - CUP_INIT_POS.y) - ((FLOWER_INIT_SCA.y + CUP_INIT_SCA.y) / 2.0f);

    if (x_distance < 0.0f && y_distance < 0.0f)
    {
        LOG("COLLISION!");
    }

    // The rest of our transformation stuff below
}
```

Running this as if, I get the following behaviour:

![collision-ex-2](assets/collision-ex-2.png)

<sub>**Figure 11**: We have a collision, even when the _visible_ parts of our sprite aren't touching.</sub>

This is what I meant above when I said that you might have to fine-tune your numbers depending on your sprites. After playing around with it some more, I determined that a "collision factor" of `0.09f` gives me a bit more of what I would like a collision to look like:
